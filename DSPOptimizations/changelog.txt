- v1.1.16
	- fixed bug with calculating sphere power
- v1.1.15
	- removed dyson colour optmization for compatibility with v0.10 of DSP
- v1.1.14
	- removed prototype code that should have been disabled. this might fix the bug where assemblers don't always run when they should
- v1.1.13
	- optimized monitor logic
- v1.1.12
	- updated station multithreading for compatibility with v0.9.27 of DSP
	- optimized the dismantling of dense spheres
- v1.1.11
	- further optimized dyson node logic, where buffer updates won't be run for invisible swarms
	- updated factory reset command to work with latest DSP update
- v1.1.10
	- updated station multithreading for compatibility with v0.9.26 of DSP
- v1.1.9
	- fixed vanilla bug where splitters and pilers may have their performance stats counted twice for the last factory
	- fixed bug where dyson shell colours aren't updated immediately
- v1.1.8
	- further optimization ejected sails down to ~15% of normal cpu time
	- fixed bug with swarm gpu stats
	- optimized dyson nodes to not update their colour on tick. should further improve ups for dense spheres
- v1.1.7
	- added optimization for ejected sails along with the option to hide them
- v1.1.6
	- added a compatibility fix for the black box mod
	- added factory, swarm, and sphere reset commands
- v1.1.5
	- fixed a bug where selecting other saves in the save menu can reset storage multithreading info
- v1.1.4
	- fixed a bug where multithreading didn't work properly for PLSs. re-enabled storage multithreading
- v1.1.3
	- temporarily disabled the storage multithreading because of potential mod compatibility issues
- v1.1.2
	- added multithreading for station storage logic
- v1.1.1
	- improved fps for dense spheres by optimizing shell rendering
	- reduced lag caused by shader buffers being synced when a hidden layer is under construction
- v1.1.0
	- optimized dyson node logic
- v1.0.6
	- Removed the low resolution shells feature
- v1.0.5
	- fixed bug where nodes might not queue sails for absorption after importing a modded save
- v1.0.4
	- added multithreading for counting the number of cell points a shell would get in vanilla
- v1.0.3
	- moved the shell resolution panel up to fit on the screen when using a layout height of 900
- v1.0.2
    - initial release on Thunderstore
    - fixed integer overflow bug when filling shell vertices with sails when regenerating
	- added more debug logging and error checking
- v1.0.1
	- fixed issue where when first loading a save with low res shells when the .moddsv file exists from other mods, the low res shells import code isn't called. using the new version of DSPModSave should also fix the issue
- v1.0.0
	- initial pre-release on github
	- implemented low resolution shells
	- added a config option to disable shadows
