# NoVessels Mod
This mod prevents logistics vessels from being rendered. It's intended for players in the very late endgame, who have a huge number of vessels travelling at once. This will reduce GPU usage, which is ideal for AFKing.

## Installation
This mod now has a [Thunderstore release](https://dsp.thunderstore.io/package/Selsion/NoVessels/). It's recommended that you install it using [r2modman](https://dsp.thunderstore.io/package/ebkr/r2modman/) or another mod manager.
### Manual Installation
This mod requires BepInEx to be installed in order to work. First download the latest dll for this mod mod at the [releases](https://github.com/Selsion/DSPMods/releases) page. You will need to put this dll in the `BepInEx\plugins` directory. If you installed BepInEx manually, then this should be found in the game's steam directory. If you're using r2modman, then the path can be found by navigating to the settings page and clicking on "Browse profile folder". Alternatively, the path can be found at `%appdata%\r2modmanPlus-local\DysonSphereProgram\profiles\[PROFILE_NAME]\BepInEx\plugins`, where `[PROFILE_NAME]` is replaced with the name you set when you created the profile.

## Usage
Vessels will be hidden whenever this mod is enabled. There isn't any in-game toggle option, so unhiding the vessels is done by disabling the mod.
